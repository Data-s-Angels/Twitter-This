## Twitter This: A Look into the Tweets of Recent Presidential Candidates  

### Summary

#### With the increasingly significant role that social media plays in people’s lives, the use of rhetoric now extends beyond just speech and formal writing, as its effects in short written statements on the web can now cause considerable influence among its audiences. Social media, the way that it is wielded, holds an ability to share a certain narrative and sway individuals’ thoughts and opinions. Politicians – such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance – use social media to share information and opinions to the national public and make what seem like large issues more personal. The implications of social media use in the political sphere are especially poignant during times as critical as presidential campaigns and voting seasons. This project will dive into this issue, with a particular focus on political figures Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton.

#### An independent Chi-square statistical analysis, a cluster analysis, and a natural language processing (NLP) sentimental analysis will be conducted to observe the candidates’ utilization of Twitter during the respective periods that they were running for candidacy.

### Objective

#### Conduct data analyses to determine how presidential candidates use social media – with a focus on Twitter – during their respective campaigns.

### Backgroud

#### In the U.S., there has become a regular narrative of distinguishing between what is real news and what is fake. The term “fake news” became more prominently used during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Donald Trump often paraded this key phrase. He was known for his extensive use of social media, a practice that has continued in his presidency. While social media is a way for people to connect and network, Trump has demonstrated the scope of its influence in being a platform that disseminates both private and public information.  

#### This project will investigate the use of social media, focusing on Twitter, during the most recent presidential campaigns. It will address the following questions: How do Biden’s, Clinton’s, and Trump’s tweets evolve from the beginnings of their campaigns? What kinds of tweets have the highest levels of engagement? And what content is most commonly addressed in their tweets?

### Scope

#### This project will utilize data analyses in order to investigate the usage of social media in presidential campaigns. The data will be sourced from Kaggle and will be wrangled as needed to ensure its format usability when inputted into the programs. The statistical analyses will primarily be performed in R while NLP will be done in Python. The data output of interest will be mined and compiled for visualization and presentation.

### Functional Requirements

#### - Transform data into appropriate format for data mining and statistical analysis tools
#### - Interlink the datasets
#### - Perform clustering
#### - Perform comparative analysis
#### - Perform NLP sentiment analysis
#### - Index data in graphical structures

### Personnel 

#### Our team is comprised of three people (Verena, Portia and Courtney) with each person contributing to each step of the project’s process. The initial brainstorm and ideas for the project topic were determined together, and when it comes to performing the analyses and building a presentation, these are also tasks that will be tackled together. There are three analyses that we will use which we will divide respectively among us.
